## Preface

(Work in progress)
This repo was created with the only intention to show how do I structure my projects. Within, you will see a system which interacts with a fully working monorepo, and some customizations across the entire projects. You may note that I use a lot of different technologies, as listed above:
- pnpm
- Turborepo
- Next.js
- CircleCI
- Terraform
- Jest
- Playwright

Feel free to give me your feedback about this project, I'm always open to learn new things and improve my skills.

## Installation and usage
You should clone this repo first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/falanges/devops-poc-1.git
```

Then, if you don't have pnpm already installed, proceed with next options:

### On Windows
Using PowerShell:
```bash
iwr https://get.pnpm.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```
### On POSIX systems
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

If you don't have curl installed, you would like to use wget:

```bash
wget -qO- https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

```bash
npx pnpm install
```
Once you have pnpm working as expected, you can proceed with the next steps.

## Development
Turborepo cli will assist you to run the different commands, for instance, if you want to run all the apps at same time you can use the following command:

```bash
turbo run dev
```

You can opt to run just one app:
```bash
turbo run dev --filter=web
```

## Building
You can build the entire project with the following command:
```bash
turbo run build
```

## Testing
You can run the tests with the following command:
```bash
turbo run test
```

There is a way to run tests in watch mode, in case you need to:
```bash
turbo run test:watch
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.
